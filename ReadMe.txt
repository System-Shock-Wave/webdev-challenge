Dear NRI Hiring Manager,

Thanks kindly for your response.  I have taken some time to review the web development challenge linked to in your Email and I feel that your tech stack is sufficiently unfamiliar to me that I would require significant on the job training to bring me up to speed.  The majority of my experience is in MSSQL/MySQL, PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.  I have not used Laravel before and I would not want to start an interview process or even a new job on false pretenses.

I of course would be very willing to learn a new set of systems and if there is a place for a developer with my experience and a willingness to learn at your company, I would be more than happy to discuss the opportunity further.

Best Regards,
-Christopher Stuart
